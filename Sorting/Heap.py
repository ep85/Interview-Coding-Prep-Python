Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. 
It is similar to selection sort where we first find the minimum element and place the 
minimum element at the beginning. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

Big O
Best Ω(n log(n))		
Average Θ(n log(n))	
Worst Θ(n log(n))	

Space Complexity 
O(1)

Input data: 4, 10, 3, 5, 1
         4(0)
        /   \
     10(1)   3(2)
    /   \
 5(3)    1(4)

The numbers in bracket represent the indices in the array 
representation of data.

Applying heapify procedure to index 1:
         4(0)
        /   \
    10(1)    3(2)
    /   \
5(3)    1(4)

Applying heapify procedure to index 0:
        10(0)
        /  \
     5(1)  3(2)
    /   \
 4(3)    1(4)
The heapify procedure calls itself recursively to build heap
 in top down manner.
